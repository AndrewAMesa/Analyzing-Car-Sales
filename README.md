# Analyzing-Car-Sales
The three Python scripts were created to answer different conjectures on this dataset. Along with the Python language, these scripts utilize the Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize the data. The conjectures and reasons that each conjectures was accepted or rejected are listed below.

Conjecture 1: <br> 
Null Hypothesis: “We can predict a car’s selling price by analyzing its horsepower, fuel efficiency, fuel capacity, and performance power.” <br> 
Result: It was accepted due to the low training and testing errors and high r-squared value.

Conjecture 2: <br> 
Null Hypothesis: “A car's total quantity of sales is solely determined by its pricing, horsepower, or engine size." <br> 
Result: It was rejected due to large training errors, demonstrating the test was not very accurate.

Conjecture 3: <br> 
Null Hypothesis: “We can accurately predict a car's fuel capacity by looking at the factors that contribute to the size of the vehicle.” <br> 
Result: It was rejected due to accuracy (~30%) being low.

Instructions to Run Code
1) Download Python, which can be found here https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2) Ensure pip is downloaded.
3) Install necessary libraries using pip (e.g. Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.).
4) Copy files in this repository to your local machine.
5) Run the Python files. To see some graphs plt.show() must be uncommented.
