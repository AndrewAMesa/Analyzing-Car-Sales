# Analyzing-Car-Sales

Analyzing-Car-Sales is a data analysis project developed to explore and test hypotheses related to car sales using Python. 
This project leverages the Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Structure

- **Conjecture 1**:
  - **Null Hypothesis**: “We can predict a car’s selling price by analyzing its horsepower, fuel efficiency, fuel capacity, and performance power.”
  - **Result**: Accepted due to low training and testing errors and a high R-squared value, indicating a reliable predictive model.

- **Conjecture 2**:
  - **Null Hypothesis**: “A car's total quantity of sales is solely determined by its pricing, horsepower, or engine size.”
  - **Result**: Rejected, as the high training errors suggested that these factors alone do not account for total sales quantity.

- **Conjecture 3**:
  - **Null Hypothesis**: “We can accurately predict a car's fuel capacity by looking at the factors that contribute to the size of the vehicle.”
  - **Result**: Rejected due to low prediction accuracy (~30%), indicating that vehicle size alone does not sufficiently determine fuel capacity.

## Instructions to Run Code

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure `pip` is installed, then use it to install Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
     ```

3. **Download Project Files**:
   - Copy all files from this repository to your local machine.

4. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Execute each Python file using:
     ```bash
     python <filename.py>
     ```

   - **View Visualizations**: To see graphs generated by the scripts, uncomment `plt.show()` where applicable in the code.
